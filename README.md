# :file_folder: Carpet Fault Diagnosis Expert System
An interactive rule-based expert system built with CLIPS that diagnoses common carpet problems (stains, odor, fiber damage, color issues, aging, moisture problems, etc.) using a structured question–answer dialogue.
This project simulates a real expert asking sequential questions, evaluating symptoms, and generating a final diagnosis and recommended solutions.
